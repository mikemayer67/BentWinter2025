# Problem Statement

A number in a particular base is palindromic if the digits (no leading zeros allowed) read the same right to 
left as left to right. For each integer BASE N > 2, let P(N) be the decimal representation of the smallest 
integer exceeding 2N that is palindromic both in base N and in base 2.
Consider the sequence of numbers formed by including P(N) (as N is incremented by 1) provided it is larger 
than any existing P(N) already in the sequence. To wit, P(3), which can be represented as 100010001 in base 3 
and 1100111110011 in base 2 (and 6643 as a decimal) is established as the first number. P(4) which can be 
represented as 33 in base 4 and 1111 in base 2 (and 15 as a decimal), is smaller than P(3) and, therefore, 
excluded from the sequence.

- What is the first decimal numer in this sequence larger than one quadrillion?
- What is the corresponding N and which number in the sequence is it?
